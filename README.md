# ShiftManaging-SOFTENG251
Project for second year software engineering course "SOFTENG 251: Object Oriented Software Construction". A shift managing application implementing a part of the server.

A work shift manager may use this to assign staff to work during different periods for a shop in its opening hours, 'shifts'. No shifts can overlap, and many shifts divide a day. 

The application manages shifts for a week at a time, from Monday to Sunday.
